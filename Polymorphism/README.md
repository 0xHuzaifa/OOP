**Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**

Polymorphism is like having a magic wand in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that makes different things look and act the same way, even though they're different on the inside. It's all about making code more flexible and adaptable by letting us use the same method name, but with different behaviors, depending on what we're dealing with.

**Explained Simply:**

1. **Method Overriding:** Imagine you have a blueprint for making animals. Each animal can make its own special sound. Polymorphism lets us change the sound each animal makes while still using the same "makeSound" command. So, a cat might "meow," a dog might "bark," and a bird might "chirp," but we're using the same "makeSound" command for all of them.

2. **Dynamic Binding:** Think of dynamic binding like a shape-shifter. It allows our code to figure out which version of a method to use based on what's happening at that exact moment. So, if we have a bunch of different animals making sounds, dynamic binding helps us figure out which sound each animal should make, even if they all use the same "makeSound" command.

3. **Code Flexibility:** Polymorphism is like having a Swiss Army knife for coding. It lets us write code that can work with lots of different things without knowing all the tiny details about each one. So, whether we're dealing with a cat, a dog, or a bird, as long as they all have a "makeSound" method, our code can handle them without any problems.

**Example:**
```typescript

// Parent class representing an animal
class Animal {
    constructor(public name: string) {}

    // Method to make a sound
    makeSound(): void {
        console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound`);
    }
}

// Subclass representing a Cat
class Cat extends Animal {
    constructor(name: string) {
        super(name);
    }

    // Override makeSound method for Cat
    makeSound(): void {
        console.log(`${this.name} says Meow!`);
    }
}

// Subclass representing a Dog
class Dog extends Animal {
    constructor(name: string) {
        super(name);
    }

    // Override makeSound method for Dog
    makeSound(): void {
        console.log(`${this.name} says Woof!`);
    }
}

// Subclass representing a Bird
class Bird extends Animal {
    constructor(name: string) {
        super(name);
    }

    // Override makeSound method for Bird
    makeSound(): void {
        console.log(`${this.name} says Chirp!`);
    }
}

// Function to make animals make sounds
function makeAnimalsMakeSounds(animals: Animal[]): void {
    animals.forEach(animal => {
        animal.makeSound();
    });
}

// Creating instances of Cat, Dog, and Bird
let cat = new Cat("Whiskers");
let dog = new Dog("Buddy");
let bird = new Bird("Tweetie");

// Making animals make sounds
makeAnimalsMakeSounds([cat, dog, bird]);
```
